    Baseball is the only sport that forces the team that is winning to continue to play out the game.<br>
    Baseball is so good that teams don't need to have cheerleaders to distract the crowd from a really horrible loss.<br>
    While other sports bash you over the head with time restraints where the quarters or periods stick to 15-minute intervals, baseball is relaxed and carefree.<br>
    There is no sport that values history as much as baseball does. Every season in baseball, records are set and crushed. <br>
    Baseball fans make treks to the baseball fields of the U.S. <br> 
    No matter where your team loyalty lies, fans want to see a game at famous ballparks like Fenway Park or Wrigley field.<br>
    Baseball is the only sport that forces the team that is winning to continue to play out the game. <br>
    The home run is possibly the most exciting and completely awesome scoring in all of sports. <br>
    The ballpark is a sold-out crowd, and the fans are more rowdy than usual. <br>
    Before the Boston Red Sox started winning anything, they were supposedly under the Curse of The Bambino. <br>
     But every year their fans were out there cheering their hearts out and praying for a miracle.<br></center>
